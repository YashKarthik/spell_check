# spell_check
A program to identify misspelled words in a text file and corrects some of them, using another text file as dictionary.

##### Files: 
              1)autocorrect.py - the main program to find a correct the mistakes
              2)dict.txt - program uses this file as a dictinary, only the words included in this file will run.
              3)check_them.txt - file containing the misspelt words.
              4)output.txt - file into which the correct statements are printed.

Please give a more sensible text in check_them.txt for correction, beacause what I gave is nonsense. 

###### NOTE: SPELLCHECKER IS NOT AN INBUILT MODULE SO YOU GOTTA INSTALL IT SEPARETELY
